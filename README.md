# Bottle Anomaly Detection (MVTec)

Unsupervised basic anomaly detection system using
deep feature extraction and reconstruction-based techniques, deployed as an
interactive **Streamlit web application**.

## Methods
- YOLOv8-based object localization (optional preprocessing)
- ResNet18 (ImageNet pretrained) for deep feature extraction
- Feature-level anomaly scoring using distance-based metrics
- Patch-wise feature aggregation for fine-grained anomaly localization
- ROC-AUC evaluation for quantitative performance analysis

## Deployment
- Streamlit-based web application
- Upload and analyze bottle images in real time
- Visual anomaly heatmaps and confidence scores
- Optimized inference for CPU and GPU environments

## Key Insights
- Smooth and structured objects like bottles are well-suited for feature-based
  anomaly detection
- Pretrained CNN features capture subtle surface defects effectively
- Simpler models with strong representations outperform deeper but unfocused architectures

## Dataset
- **MVTec Anomaly Detection Dataset**
- Category used: `Bottle`
- Training data contains **only normal samples**

## Demo
